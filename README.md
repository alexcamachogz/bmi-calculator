### Recently Learned

Segues are visual connectors between view controllers in the storyboards, shown as lines between two controllers. They allow you to present one view controller from another.

```Swift
override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
  if segue.identifier == "goToResult" {
      let destinationVC = segue.destination as! ResultViewController
      destinationVC.bmiValue = calculatorBrain.getBMIValue()
      destinationVC.bmiAdvice = calculatorBrain.getAdvice()
      destinationVC.bmiColor = calculatorBrain.getColor()
  }
}
```
